Quadcopter TODO
===============================================================================

Phase 1:
--------
	[X] Import Mbed library from Github
	[X] Get basic Makefile to Compile blinky test program.
	[X] Test that the blinky test program works
	[X] Begin Importing from UWB-Quadcopter on Github
	[X] Set up directory structure


Phase 2:
--------
	[X] Flatten Out Mbed Library
		[X] MCU Target
		[X] Makefile Compilation
	[X] Get Serial Working (and efficiently)
		- Look at pin mapping for the Nucleo
		- Do I need to jump cables from the main board to the breakoff board?
		- Do I need to use the USBSerial library? (I hope not!)
	[ ] Get LED's Working
    [ ] Get Button Presses Working
	[X] Get Sonars Working
		[X] Get something basic working in main.cpp
		[X] Create Class
		[X] Add sliding window averager to the signal
	[ ] Fix / Clean Up Mbed Library
		[ ] Remove Use of Malloc In Serial Class
		[ ] Add Float, Int, Long, Hex, Char, etc. outputs to Serial class
		[ ] Fix typing in Timer Class (uint32_t to int, and uint64_t to uint32_t)
		[X] Look at how they have interrupts set up
			[X] Callbacks, data pointers needed by the callback
			[x] Do they use a table? If so, would this waste space?
				- Yes, they do use a table, with pre-defined callback routines
		[X] Investigate How Many GPIO Interrupts We Can Have (7 it seems)
			- So, whereas 
	[ ] Create System Clock
		[ ] Use Timer class?
		[ ] Use ticker C api?
		[ ] Use SysTick directly?
	[X] Get Servos Working
	[ ] Get Gyro/Accel Working
		[X] Get Raw Data
		[ ] Update to burst reads
		[ ] Create better container for values
		[ ] Add Scaling Interface
		[ ] Document the Class / Functions
	[ ] Get Speed Controller / Brushless motor working
    [X] Start Looking at Designing a Custom PCB
    	[X] Can I get information from STM?
    		- Yes, yes you can! (And you already have it :-) )

Phase 3:
--------
	[ ] Investigate Different Code Stuffs
		[ ] Convert Everything from C++ --> C (yes, including the Mbed API), check code size and speed.
		[ ] 
	[ ] Add Notes to the Github Wiki
		- Changes to Mbed
		- Notes on Interrupts (how many we can have, maps to pins not banks, etc.)
		- Links to Mbed Site
		- Links to STMicro PDF's (regarding this chip)
		- Notes on Game Loops / Event Loops (link to the article)
		- Add TODO list to main page
		- Add notes on I2C (w.r.t accelerometer)
	[ ] Add a scheduler?
		[ ] How to add from interrupt service routines?
	[ ] Add an event loop?
	[ ] Robust Positioning System
		[ ] Kalman Filter
			[ ] Euler Orientation
			[ ] Quaternion Orientation
		[ ] Low-pass Filter (Complementary Filter)
			[ ] Euler Orientation
			[ ] Quaternion Orientation
	[ ] Basic PID Filter
		[ ] Needs to Store N Previous positioning measurements
		[ ] Needs to Store N Previous Motor Commands (maybe, not 100% sure)
	[ ] Rudimentary control mechanism to control base motor speed
		[ ] Potentiometer?
		[ ] Buttons connected to GPIO pins?
		[ ] IR Receiver?
		[ ] 


Phase 4:
--------
	[ ] Buy quadcopter motors
	[ ] Buy quadcopter speed controllers
	[ ] Buy quadcopter frame
	[ ] Mount board and IMU to quadcopter frame
	[ ] Get quadcopter hovering (using rudimentary control mechanism)


Phase 5:
--------
	[ ] Add more complex control mechanism
		[ ] Bluetooth?
		[ ] PS3 Controller?
		[ ] Lift off
		[ ] Strafe left / right
		[ ] Move forward and back
		[ ] Turn left / right
	[ ] Get quadcopter to move appropriately
		[ ] Calibrate any variables
		[ ] Set maximum values for safety


Phase 6:
--------
	[ ] Integrate Sonar's into quadcopter frame
	[ ] Get quadcopter to lift off and move to altitude
	[ ] Quadcopter should avoid being touched (should move out of way)


Phase 7:
--------
	[ ] Integrate bluetooth
	[ ] Integrate Wifi
	[ ] Integrate IR receivers


Phase 8:
--------
	[ ] Make computer (wifi) based control system


Phase 9:
--------
	[ ] 



Unsorted:
---------
	[ ] Integrate Tegra K1 Board  / System Design
		[ ] Communication with K1
			- WiFi?
			- Bluetooth LE?
			- SPI?
			- I2C?
			- Serial?
			- If wireless, encrypted? (Probably)
		[ ] Debug Serial via Serial Cable to USB
		[ ] Capture, process, and output computer vision data
		[ ] Power supply
			- Minimum of 1 hour of flight
			- Easy battery swap out
			- Lightweight
		[ ] Long range communication
		[ ] Capture diagnostic information
		[ ] Testing
			- Test each module
			- Try to automate it as much as possible
		[ ] Multiple Microcontrollers?
			- How much should be moved to just being on main CPU?
				- Path Planning?
				- Path Following?
		[ ] 
	[ ] Print Custom Circuit Board
	[ ] Add a high definition camera
	[ ] Use a raspberry pi on the board itself?

	[ ] Replace Mbed API and HAL to make NASA JPL C Standards Compliant
		[ ] Make JPL C Standards Compliant
		[ ] Make MISRA Compliant
		[ ] Try to keep the API (expand on it where necessary)
